<h1>Research Paper on Matrix Multiplication using Multithreading in Python</h1>

## About Me

In this repository, I utilized a Python module for multithreading to showcase the practical application of matrix multiplication. I aimed to demonstrate my solid understanding of linear algebra by successfully implementing multithreading and performing performance analysis.

During the project, I observed that the runtime of the multithreading module was affected by frequent thread switches. Python's single-thread execution had a noticeable impact on the overall performance. 

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to understand the implementation details and performance analysis. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
